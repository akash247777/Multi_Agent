Input Sentence:

“AI literacy is becoming essential for students and educators.” 

1. Rewritten Long-Form Text:
AI literacy is no longer a niche skill — it is a fundamental competency required for both students and educators to thrive in a world
increasingly shaped by intelligent systems. Students need to understand how AI makes decisions, recognize bias in algorithms, and use 
tools ethically to solve problems. Educators, meanwhile, must move beyond fear or fascination to actively integrate AI into pedagogy —
using it to personalize learning, reduce administrative overload, and foster critical thinking. Without AI literacy, learners risk being 
passive consumers of technology rather than informed creators and critics. Schools that delay integration risk widening equity gaps, as
access to AI fluency becomes a new determinant of future opportunity. The time to act is now: embedding AI literacy into curricula isn’t
optional — it’s foundational to 21st-century education.
