The future of learning in India isn’t just digital — it’s democratizing. 🌏📚

With over 400 million students, India stands at the edge of an education revolution. Here’s what’s changing:

✅ AI tutors adapting to individual learning paces — no more one-size-fits-all classrooms.
✅ Virtual labs and AR-powered lessons bringing science to life in villages without labs.
✅ NITI Aayog’s “Digital India” and NEP 2020 pushing skill-based, experiential learning over rote memorization.

Over 1.5 million schools are now digitally connected. But the real challenge? Ensuring every child — from Jharkhand to Jammu — has equitable access.

How do we turn connectivity into true inclusion? Who should lead this change: government, startups, or communities?

Let’s build the future — together. 👇
