This workflow automates content creation by taking a single topic and generating a complete content package through sequential 
AI processing steps. I chose Google’s Gemini API because it offers enterprise-grade generative AI with strong multilingual and
cultural understanding — especially valuable for context-rich topics like “Future of Learning in India.” Each step uses a dedicated
prompt template to guide Gemini into producing structured outputs: blog outlines for planning, LinkedIn posts for professional audiences, 
social captions for engagement, and hashtags for discoverability. The workflow uses the google-generativeai Python library to interact
with the Gemini API. A key limitation is rate limiting on free API keys and lack of fine-tuned control over output length compared to
OpenAI. Possible improvements include adding output validation, caching responses, integrating with Google Sheets for batch processing,
and using Gemini’s multimodal capabilities to generate infographics from the same topic later.
